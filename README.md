# Sxhkd Cheatsheet

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white")

This program generates a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) cheatsheet of your [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) configuration file.  
It was heavily inspired from [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org)'s widget I saw in [this](https://youtu.be/1QQps1qTgG4?t=216) YouTube video from [Chris Titus Tech](https://christitus.com).

-   ðŸ’¼ Works out of the box with the default sxhkd configuration (no need to edit the sxhkd config file)

## Build
